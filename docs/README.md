## Register

Register is a template class used to represent and manipulate any register. It can simulate complex behaviors thanks to its embedded callback mechanism. You can find a starting-up guide for Register creation and manipulation [here](register/README.md).

##Â RegisterFile

RegisterFile is a container class for registers and other RegisterFile's instances. All elements inserted to a RegisterFile are memory-mapped. A starting-up guide introducing RegisterFile's instanciation, manipulation and behavior [here](registerfile/README.md).
